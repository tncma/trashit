### Idea ###

TrashIt is an Android app to enable crowdsourced garbage reporting. In order to motivate users to participate, we introduce a gamification element to this. Key interactions of the "game" would be as follows

	- User tags garbage with photo and is rewarded with x "bounty"
	- User can assign "bounty" to said garbage
	- User can clear garbage which has bounty assigned and claim the bounty
	- "Clear garbage" is an arbitrary action said to be completed by "verification" from garbage tagger
	- Verification to be done by uploading before and after images
